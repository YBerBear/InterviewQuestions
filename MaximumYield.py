#  #6 - Maximum yield
#
#You are a Science Engineer on the Federation mining freighter Daedalus. 
#Your team mines strips for a special type of dilithium that is rare 
#and particularly volatile. This has certain implications.
#When your team mines a square in the strip, the trace amounts of 
#dilithium that remain become charged for years. Your team simply cannot 
#mine two squares that are side by side or this would result in an 
#explosion and destroy the planet.
#The shipâ€™s sensors can detect the quantity of dilithium 
#in each square in advance. Your team needs to know the optimal 
#squares it should mine, as well as the total yield from a strip of 
#any size so they can bring it before the captain for final approval.
#Two strip examples:
#[ 206, 140, 300, 52, 107 ] should return 613 units, as mining the first, 
#                           third, and fifth squares is optimal 
#                           [ 206, x, 300, x, 107 ]
#[ 147, 206, 52, 240, 300 ] should return 506 units, as mining the second 
#                           and fifth squares is optimal 
#                           [ x, 206, x, x, 300 ]

### Two test cases: use one at a time.
#   Uncomment the desired "strip"
#   Comment out another one

## Test case 1
#strip = [ 206, 140, 300, 52, 107 ]

## Test case 2
strip = [ 147, 206, 52, 240, 300 ] 

print ("The strip to evaluate",strip)
optimalsquares = sensor(strip)
profit = sum(optimalsquares)
print ("Profit: ", profit, ", Optimal Squares (zero means \"no digging here\"):\n",14*' ', optimalsquares)
